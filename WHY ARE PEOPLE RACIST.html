    <h2>WHY ARE PEOPLE RACIST?</h2>
<p>It’s a question that people ask all the time.
If we’re all part of the human race, why are
people racist?
After all, there are no biological differences between
people. No race is superior or inferior to another.
We’re all the same.
There are many reasons why people can have racist attitudes. 
We take on the views of people
around us
A lot of our attitudes are shaped when we’re young.
When our family members or friends express racist
opinions, it’s common that we will take on those views
ourselves. The problem is that, unless we do something
about it, they can stay with us for a lifetime.
We hang around with people
“like us”
It’s normal to want to spend time with people that have
the same interests, background, culture and language.
It creates a sense of belonging that is really important.
The downside is that it can also set up differences
between other groups and, over time, this might lead
to us to thinking that our group is better than others. 
We’re quick to judge
We often put labels on people. He dresses like this so
he must be into this music. She goes to that school
so she must be rich. We can also stereotype people
from different racial backgrounds as “lazy”, “brainy”,
“aggro”… you get the idea. The way to beat the
stereotypes? Don’t judge a whole group. Get to know
people from different racial backgrounds and find out
how much you have in common.
We blame others for our problems
When we feel angry or frustrated, we often look
for someone else to blame for our problems. As a
community, we can do the same thing. People who
look or talk differently to us are an easy target. You
can hear it happening today in comments like, “those
people take our jobs” or “they get government
handouts all the time”. Nearly all the time, these
statements are wrong.
There are no reasons or excuses for racism. It’s just
wrong. And In many cases, racism is against the law.

factsheet.
