    <h2>Discrimination</h2>
<p>
Discrimination strikes at the very heart of being human. 
 It is treating someone differently simply because of who they are or what they believe.

We all have the right to be treated equally, regardless of our race, ethnicity, nationality, class, 
caste, religion, belief, sex, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, age,health or other status. 
Yet all too often we hear heart-breaking stories of people who suffer cruelty simply for belonging to a “different” group from those in power.

<br><h3>Fight against Racism, Discrimination and Xenophobia</h3>
UNESCO contributes to the fight against racism and discrimination through research, normative instruments and operational programmes and projects.

New forms of discrimination have arisen, in association with certain scientific developments and the process of globalization.
 As a result of these new threats and the outbreak of violent inter-ethnic conflicts in many parts of the world in recent years, t
 he international community decided to convene in 2001 in Durban, South Africa, the World Conference Against Racism, 
 Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.<br> In close collaboration with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), UNESCO participated actively in the Durban Conference,
 which was undoubtedly the high point of the Third United Nations Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, which ended in 2003.
