    <h2>Racism and Its Effect on Society</h2>
<p>Throughout world history, governments have violated and ignored the human and civil rights of their citizens. In some instances, they demonstrated this disregard through customs, etiquette, and racial caste systems that denied human dignity and respect. In most cases, in addition to these customs, segregation rules and laws were established.

Governments have also endorsed the extermination (ethnic cleansing) of entire classes or races of people. 
Racism is devastating to a country and its culture. Racism causes tremendous moral, cultural, 
and economic suffering to a country. When the seeds of hatred and ethnocentrism are planted and 
fostered in society, it negatively affects every area of life.
<br><h3>When Racism is Allowed to Thrive</h3>
Racism does not allow for a collective contribution of its citizens, which is a critical component of a country’s development and success. If a class of people is not allowed to be educated, they cannot make important contributions to society in technological, economical, and medical arenas. The denial of quality education to certain groups of people only serves to obstruct the economic progress of a nation.

If a class of people is not allowed to participate culturally, we fail to understand and appreciate our differences and similarities. We become increasingly ethnocentric. We fail to develop socially, unable to get along with our fellow man. No matter how hard a society might try to separate classes or races, the bottom line is that, eventually, we will, at least on some occasions, share the same space. Therefore, it is imperative that we are accepting, not merely tolerant, of others. The connotation for tolerance is that one must acknowledge the other, whereas acceptance encourages complete participation and fellowship.

Racism destroys our morality. No matter what a person’s culture or religious belief, racism is based on hypocrisy. To illustrate this point, the Christians have a commandment, issued by Jesus, to “love your neighbor as you love yourself.” Most religions have similar philosophies governing their social morality. Yet, there is the hypocrisy in going out into the night to burn crosses or participating in hate crimes. Racism is powerful enough to undermine their Golden Rule and turn it upside down.

Many times we, as societies and individuals, think that racism will dissipate on its own; so, we ignore it, repeatedly. In 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., made a profound statement in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail”:

"When you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see the tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people, you will understand why we find it difficult to wait (for change)."

His message is so clear that racism is most damaging to the children in the society in which they live.

The pathology is dehumanization. The cure is humanism.
